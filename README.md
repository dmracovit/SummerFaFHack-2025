# AI Balance Trainer üéØ

A Moodle plugin that teaches students how to collaborate effectively with AI while maintaining their independence and critical thinking skills.

## What is AI Balance Trainer?

AI Balance Trainer is an educational tool that implements a **5-level progression system** to help students learn balanced AI collaboration. Instead of becoming overly dependent on AI or avoiding it entirely, students learn to use AI as a strategic learning partner while developing their own problem-solving abilities.

## How It Works

1. **Start**: New users begin at Tutor Mode with comprehensive AI guidance
2. **Advance**: System calculates independence ratio and advances students to higher levels
3. **Master**: Students learn to use AI strategically while maintaining independent thinking

## Features

### üìö Multi-Subject Support
- **Programming**: Code challenges, debugging, algorithm design
- **Writing**: Essays, technical documentation, creative writing
- **Mathematics**: Problem solving, proofs, calculations
- **General**: Cross-disciplinary learning support

### üèÜ Challenge System
- Interactive subject-specific tasks with difficulty progression
- Self-assessment of AI dependency vs. independence


### üìä Progress Tracking
- Real-time independence development across subjects
- Usage analytics and interaction patterns
- Performance metrics (AI-assisted vs. independent scores)
